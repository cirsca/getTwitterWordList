WHAT?
=====

I wanted to be able to pull data from a .txt file and save what it returned me to a MongoDB collection while giving certain lists certain weights. It was harder than I thought and will need to be refractored eventually.

#### Useful?

Probably not. This is one of my first Node projects from scratch and it could probably be better. Why not make it better? Advice and critique always welcome.

#### Why?

I want analyse some data about tweets against a list of weighted words. This is a good foundation for that and accomplished my goal of pulling data from an HTTP request, saving it to a MongoDB, and being able to fetch it later.
